Case studies
------------

Detailed case studies of using resistics will go here. These will be more complete examples of using resistics to process all the data in field survey. The motivations behind making these public is to provide more examples to users and as importantly, invite any feedback or suggestions on improving magnetotelluric processing. If you have any field survey data you are willing to share in this section, please get in contact. In particularly, noisy data is welcomed.
