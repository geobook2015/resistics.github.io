Resistics was originally developed by Neeraj Shah, who also continues to maintain the package. Inspiration for the project has come from people within the magnetotelluric community. Particular mention goes to Dr. Friedemann Samrock at ETH Zurich for providing assistance and a keen eye and Professor Martin O. Saar, also of ETH Zurich, for the opportunity to learn more about the field.
