Remote reference statistics
---------------------------

The standard resistics :doc:`statistics` concentrate on local, single site transfer function estimation. To help restrict windows for remote reference processing, a set of remote reference statistics are included. 

The remote reference statistics are largely remote reference equivalents of the standard, single site statistics. More information about each remote reference statistic is available in the corresponding subsections.
